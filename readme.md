# Website Analysis: Twitter

This project presents a detailed analysis of the social media platform, Twitter. As part of a course assignment, an existing website was chosen to undergo a comprehensive review. The analysis, completed by May 17, is divided into five key sections: Introduction, Strategy, Usability, Content & Readability, and Conclusion & Recommendations. The assessment examines Twitter's purpose, services, business strategy, design effectiveness, page load speed, information accessibility, link functionality, browser compatibility, mobile responsiveness, font and content readability, as well as color contrast. The project culminates with a conclusion summarizing the findings and suggesting potential improvements. Please refer to the attached PDF for a comprehensive overview of the analysis.

## Findings and Conclusion

The analysis concludes that Twitter is a well-designed social media platform that provides useful features and services for its users. However, there are opportunities for improvement, specifically in interface customization, advanced search functionality, moderation and management of content, and color contrast, especially in dark mode.
